## Sample project

Please see [an example of a data science project](https://github.com/slalom-ubc-mds/Power-Price-Prediction/tree/main) for your inspiration of how to structure a Github repo, and how to complete a data science pipeline. 

Please note that this is for your reference only, and we don't expect the project in this course to be as complex as such. Furthermore, the main learning goals of ADSC 3910 is not to build a fancy ML/DL pipeline or interactive visualization dashboard. The main goals of ADSC 3910 is to apply what you learn on non-SQL databases and PySpark to apply them in a simple data science project to answer a meaningful question.
