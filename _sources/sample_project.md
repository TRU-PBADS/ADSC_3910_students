## Sample project

Hereâ€™s [an example of a data science project](https://github.com/slalom-ubc-mds/Power-Price-Prediction/tree/main) to guide you on structuring a GitHub repository and completing a data science pipeline.

Please note that this example is for reference only. The project in this course is not expected to be as complex. The primary learning objectives of ADSC 3910 are not to create an elaborate ML/DL pipeline or an interactive visualization dashboard. Instead, the main goals of ADSC 3910 are to apply your knowledge of non-SQL databases and PySpark in a straightforward data science project that addresses a meaningful question.

## Sample cookie cutter repo template

The cookie cutter data science template provides a logical, flexible, and reasonably standardized project structure for doing and sharing data science work.

You don't have to use this but it just serve as a reference of how to structure a repo for a data science project.
