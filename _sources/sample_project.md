## Sample project

Hereâ€™s [an example of a data science project](https://github.com/slalom-ubc-mds/Power-Price-Prediction/tree/main) to guide you on structuring a GitHub repository and completing a data science pipeline.

Please note that this example is for reference only. The project in this course is not expected to be as complex. The primary learning objectives of ADSC 3910 are not to create an elaborate ML/DL pipeline or an interactive visualization dashboard. Instead, the main goals of ADSC 3910 are to apply your knowledge of non-SQL databases and PySpark in a straightforward data science project that addresses a meaningful question.
