## Teamwork contract

During the first week, each student group will establish two teamwork documents:

1. Teamwork contract
2. Code of conduct

These documents should be made easily and clearly available to the team. For example, they may be included in the team's GitHub repository. 

## 1. Teamwork Contract

The teamwork contract describes the parameters for how the team will operate. The teamwork contract is a living document: it may evolve throughout the course as the group re-evaluates the contract's effectiveness.

Here are some recommendations of things to include in your contract: 

1. Establish modes of communication amongst your teammates. Remember, capstone is fluid; these modes can change throughout the project if appropriate.  
    - Unless you have reason to suggest otherwise, three modes are useful:
        - A communication channel for your group members (e.g., preferably Slack).
        - GitHub Issues, on your main project repo where you will be developing your data product.
        - In-person meetings and/or remote meetings.
    - Distinguish what these different modes will be used for. Use GH Issues for self-contained topics that have some permanence so them, as they are possibly useful to refer to in the future; use Slack for ephemeral, conversational messages.
2. Establish a task management system. Where will you store store and manage all of your to-do's. GH Projects and Issues? Asana? Todoist? Nozbe? etc.
3. Discuss the a group-specific meeting schedule and expectations on availability. For example, should group members be available between 10am - 4pm every day? Will the group meet everyday or just on Mondays and Fridays, etc.
4. Discuss expectations on communicaton and contributions. Will different members manage different aspects of the group or will everyone contribute equally. If a group member cannot complete an assigned task, how and when should they let the group know? etc.

[Example of a teamwork contract here](https://github.com/slalom-ubc-mds/Power-Price-Prediction/blob/main/TEAMWORK_CONTRACT.md)

Each member should "sign" (you can just type out your name) at the bottom of the submission.

## 2. Code of Conduct

A code of conduct defines standards and expectations for how the memebrs of the group engage, communicate, and behave towards one another. It also outlines procedures for addressing problems between members of the group.

[Example of such CoC here](https://github.com/slalom-ubc-mds/Power-Price-Prediction/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

Each member should "sign" (you can just type out your name) at the bottom of the submission.
