# ADSC 3910 - Applied Data Science Integrated Practice 2
This course will provide the opportunity for students to apply and practice their data science skills by developing an end-to-end data science project. The course follows a project format, which consists of multiple milestones to help guide students in creating their data science pipeline. We will focus on the application of non-relational database with MongoDB and using PySpark for data analysis at scale. 

## Learning objectives

By the end of this course, students are expected be able to:
- Identify an interesting data science question for which data are available or obtainable.
- Define the scope of a possible solution, create a proposal and a timeline with key milestones.
- Create a fully reproducible data science pipeline, packaged in a Github repository.
- Utilize MongoDB as a database system.
- Utilize PySpark in processing and analyzing the data.
- Work collaboratively as a team to create, document, and present (using written, oral, and visual means) the process and results from a solution to a data science problem.

## Attendance, late assignments, academic concessions, academic accomodation

### Attendance
Please refer to [TRU's attendance policy](https://www.tru.ca/__shared/assets/Policy_ED_03-135351.pdf). In addition, we will take attendance during class via Moodle's QR code

### Academic concessions
If you encounter situations that may impede your ability to meet course requirements—such as illness, family emergencies, or other significant life events—please notify the instructor **at least 24 hours before deadline**. Academic concessions, including extensions or alternative assessments, will be considered on a case-by-case basis. You may be required to provide documentation to support your request. Concession requests after the deadline has passed will likely be refused. 

### Late Assignments
Assignments are expected to be submitted on time. Late submissions will incur a penalty of 25% per day, up to a maximum of 75%. After 3 days, late assignments will no longer be accepted and will receive a grade of zero. Extensions may be granted in exceptional circumstances, provided that you contact the instructor before the deadline.

### Accessbility
Students registered with the Accessibility Services who require accommodations must provide their Letter of Accommodation to the instructor as soon as possible. This letter will outline the necessary accommodations to ensure an equitable learning environment. Please ensure that this is done early in the term to facilitate timely arrangements.
