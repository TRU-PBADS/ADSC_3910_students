# Deliverable 1: Proposal Report

## 1. Deliverable Description

The proposal process is intended to set goals and directions for your group project. There are three deliverables associated with the proposal:

1. The proposal draft (completed as a group)
2. Peer reviews other proposals (completed as individual)
3. The revised proposal (completed as a group)

Here are the general tasks involved in the proposal process:

|     | Task Description                                                                                                                                                       | Date                  | Weight |

## 2. Submission Instructions

Please refer to the [submission instructions on Moodle](https://moodle.tru.ca/course/view.php?id=55823#section-2).

## 3. Proposal Components

Your proposal should contain the following sections, and should be reported in this order.

### 3.1. Introduction

The introduction should start broad, introducing the question being asked/problem needing solving and why it is important. Any relevant information to understand the question/problem and its importance should be included. The proposal should communicate the question/problem  _in your own words_. This is important to show your professor and classmates that you understand the question/problem.

Next, you should _refine_ the big-picture problem into tangible objectives that are directly addressable by data science techniques.

Finally, describe the final data product to be delivered to the partner. Example components of this product might include (but are not limited to) one or more of the following:

- A data pipeline;
- Documentation;
- A dashboard
- Etc.

### 3.2. Data Science Techniques

Describe how you will use data science techniques in the project. Be sure to discuss the appropriateness of the data for the proposed data science techniques, as well as difficulties the data might pose. You should include a description of the data (variables/features and observational units) and some examples/snippets of what the data looks like (as a table or a visualization).

Be sure to start with **simple** data science techniques to obtain a simple version of your data science product. There are two benefits to this approach. First, the simple method gives you a baseline to which you can compare future results. Second, the simple method may solve the problem, in which case you don't need something more complicated. For example, if dealing with time series data, your first model might be a naive or ETS, it should not be an LSTM.

Explain how your project utilizes the concepts, or tools of other ADSC courses in this term. 

Include clear success criteria for the project. This includes which evaluation metrics you are going to use and why.

### 3.3. Timeline

Indicate a rough timeline of the project, including the milestones you hope to achieve.

### 3.4 References

A list of references with a citation style of your choice.

## 4. Grading

### 4.1 Peer-review activity
- Each student will be assigned 2 proposals for peer review. You will write up the feedback, length of 1 page each, for each group proposal under their group's Github Issues
- Peer review is worth 5% of your grade.
- Peer review activity is to be completed individually 

Your feedback will be graded based on:
- **Preparednesss**: The reviewer shows a deep understanding of the proposal, reads it carefully, and shows critical thinking.
- **Constructiveness**: The suggestions provided are highly constructive, actionable, and framed in a positive manner.
- **Professionalism**: Feedback is professional, respectful, and written in a supportive tone.

### 4.2. Proposal Report

The proposal report should be a maximum of 1200 words (excluding appendices, figure captions, and table captions). The audience of your report is different to your proposal and is composed of:

1. Your professor;
2. Your classmates.

From your report, we expect:

- Excellent writing, including:
  - Low-level (sentence) structure:
    - Your report is written using complete sentences and proper grammar.
    - Everything is written in your own words and you include citations where appropriate.
    - You mean what you say, and say what you mean.
    - Each sentence is necessary in communicating the message of your report.
    - The language you use must be accessible to all audiences (which is probably non-technical), but detailed enough so that you can get adequate feedback on the path you are choosing to take with the project.
  - High-level (paragraph and section) structure:
    - The organization of your report makes sense.
    - The context is properly set at all times.

The report should be concise. The content of the proposal itself will be graded under the following guidelines:

- The business needs that you are trying to address are convincing.
- The proposed products are useful.
- The proposed data science approach is thoughtful, and **starts simple**.


#### 4.2.1 Using a Reproducible Tool

The proposal should be created using a reproducible tool (e.g., Jupyter notebook, or Markdown). You should avoid including code in the proposal.
