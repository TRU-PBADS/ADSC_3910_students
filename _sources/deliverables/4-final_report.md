## Report Structure

### 1. **Title Page (Not Included in Word Count)**  
   - **Project Title**
   - **Your Name**
   - **Course Name**
   - **Instructor's Name**
   - **Submission Date**

### 2. **Abstract (150-200 words)**  
   Provide a concise summary of the entire project. This should include:
   - The problem being addressed
   - The role of MongoDB and PySpark in the solution
   - A brief description of your methodology
   - Key results and conclusions

### 3. **Introduction (200-300 words)**  
   - **Project Context and Motivation:** Briefly explain the data science problem you are solving and its relevance to real-world applications.
   - **Introduction to the Tech Stack:** Describe the tech stack in more detail, MongoDB and PySpark, and any additional libraries or tools that were essential to your project (e.g., databricks, conda, etc...). 

### 4. **Methodology (500-700 words)**  
   - **Data Source(s):** Describe where the data comes from and why it is appropriate for your project.
   - **Data Structure:** Provide details about the format, size, and types of data you worked with.
   - **Preprocessing Steps:** Explain the data cleaning, transformation, and preparation steps taken to make the data usable for analysis. If applicable, describe any challenges encountered in this process (e.g., missing data, schema issues in MongoDB).
   - **Modelling approach** Discuss the algorithms you chose. Describe how you trained the model, including any techniques used to improve performance (e.g., cross-validation, grid search for hyperparameter tuning, or early stopping in deep learning models). Specify the training/test split or validation strategies used to prevent overfitting and ensure generalization
   - **Evaluation metrics** Discuss how you evaluated the performance of your machine learning model.
   - **Reproducbility** Discuss the steps you have taken to ensure the data pipeline is reproducible
   - If possible, create a diagram to summarize the whole pipeline

### 5. **Results and Analysis (200-300 words)**  
   - **Findings:** Present the key results of your analysis, supported by relevant figures, tables, or visualizations.
   - **Strengths and Limitations:** Reflect on the strengths and limitations of using MongoDB and PySpark for this project. What aspects of the project were particularly challenging or rewarding? Are there any limitations in your approach or tools that future work could address?
   - **Future Work:** Suggest potential areas for further exploration or improvements in methodology, data collection, or processing. What other techniques or tools could be incorporated to enhance the project?

### 6. **Reflection on Challenges and Learning (150-200 words)**  
   - **Challenges Encountered:** Reflect on any difficulties or obstacles you faced while working with MongoDB, PySpark, or the overall data science process. 
   - **What You Learned:** Discuss the key takeaways from your project. How has your understanding of MongoDB, PySpark, or data science in general evolved? What would you do differently if you were to redo the project or continue to build upon it?
 - 
### 7.  **References**  
   - Include a list of all sources you referenced during the project. This could include research papers, documentation for MongoDB and PySpark, or any other relevant resources.
   - Use a consistent citation style (e.g., APA, MLA).
