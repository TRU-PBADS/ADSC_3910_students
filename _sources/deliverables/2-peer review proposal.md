# Deliverable 1: Proposal Presentation and Report

## 1. Deliverable Description

The proposal process is intended to set goals and directions for your capstone project. There are two deliverables associated with the proposal which you will complete as a group:

1. An oral presentation; and,
2. A report.

Here are the general tasks involved in the proposal process:

|     | Task Description                                                                                                                                                       | Date                  | Graded? |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------- |
| 1   | Develop the [components of the proposal presentation and report](#3-proposal-components) with your group.                                                              | -                     | -       |
| 2   | Present the proposal presentation to your colleagues and project mentor.                                                                                               | Friday May 3          | Yes     |
| 3   | Submit a draft written proposal to the project mentor.                                                                                                                 | Tuesday May 7, 18:00 | No      |
| 4   | Revise your report by incorporating feedback from your project mentor (in some cases this may involve more than one round of revisions).                               | -                     | -       |
| 5   | After receiving permission from the project mentor, submit the finalized proposal to the capstone partner and project mentor.                                          | Friday May 10, 18:00  | Yes     |
| 6   | It is recommended that you meet with your capstone partner afterwards to ensure that the goals and directions indicated in the proposal indeed align with their needs. | -                     | -       |

## 2. Submission Instructions

Please refer to the [submission instructions on Canvas](https://canvas.ubc.ca/courses/130316/assignments/1780248).

## 3. Proposal Components

Your proposal should contain the following sections, and should be reported in this order.

### 3.1. Executive Summary (proposal report only)

A brief and high level summary of the project proposal.

### 3.2. Introduction

The introduction should start broad, introducing the question being asked/problem needing solving and why it is important. Any relevant information to understand the question/problem and its importance should be included. The proposal should communicate the question/problem  _in your own words_. This is important to show your partner and mentor that you understand the question/problem.

Next, you should _refine_ the big-picture problem into tangible objectives that are directly addressable by data science techniques.

Finally, describe the final data product to be delivered to the partner. Example components of this product might include (but are not limited to) one or more of the following:

- A Shiny or Dash app;
- A Python or R package;
- A data pipeline;
- Documentation;
- Etc.

### 3.3. Data Science Techniques

Describe how you will use data science techniques in the project. Be sure to discuss the appropriateness of the data for the proposed data science techniques, as well as difficulties the data might pose. You should include a description of the data (variables/features and observational units) and some examples/snippets of what the data looks like (as a table or a visualization).

Be sure to always always start with **simple** data science techniques to obtain a simple version of your data science product. There are two benefits to this approach. First, the simple method gives you a baseline to which you can compare future results. Second, the simple method may solve the problem, in which case you don't need something more complicated. For example, if dealing with time series data, your first model might be a naive or ETS, it should not be an LSTM.

Include clear success criteria for the project. This includes which evaluation metrics you are going to use and why, as well as an explicit mention of what the partner is expecting and how you will know when you have met this expectation. Mention different stakeholders that will be affected by the model and why your metrics are important for them.

### 3.4. Timeline

Indicate a rough timeline of the project, including the milestones you hope to achieve.

## 4. Grading

You will receive a grade for your proposal presentation, and the report that you submit to the capstone partner, under the following guidelines. **All team members are expected to be involved equally in the proposal process.**

### 4.1. Proposal Presentation

The proposal presentation is worth 10% of your final grade and will be graded according to the [presentation rubric on Canvas](https://canvas.ubc.ca/courses/130316/assignments/1780248). For the presentations, we expect you to:

1. End on time.
    - Presentations should be 12 minutes or less, followed by an 8-minute question/feedback period.
2. Include the same components as the report.
    - The exact format is flexible and can be modified based on consultation with your mentor (for example, an executive summary isn't usually included in a presentation).
    - For the intro, start with introducing your team members and then briefly introduce what the partner organization is doing and why they are doing it (why it is important). Follow with what issue they are currently facing, and how your capstone products will add value to their organization by solving this problem (what will they be able to do with your help). Make sure to include the success criteria for your capstone products.
3. Convey the message of the proposal effectively.
    - Slides should be easy to follow and understand, ideally focusing on one purpose per slide and not contain distractions such as irrelevant content or too much text on a slide.
    - Avoid using word-heavy charts when possible and limit the number of bullets per slide.
    - If you add an image or a diagram, you should give importance to them in the presentation. All the images and diagrams should be added for a reason.
    - Include a clear take-home message per slide, possibly as the slide title.
    - If a particular slide needs to be more busy, use animations to focus the audience attention on one concept at a time.
4. Use visual elements to help convey important messages.
    - This includes schematics and charts that are easy to read and digest.
    - The overall presentation design should also be visually appealing.
5. Gear your presentation towards the audience.
    - The audience of your presentation is the MDS mentors and your colleagues/classmates. The partner organizations will not be present.
    - Make your presentations accessible to everyone in the audience by using:
        - Effective color schemes with good contrast consistently throughout the presentation. For example, avoid using green and red to represent different values since these colors are hard to distinguish for many people.
        - Large enough font sizes, including on chart labels.
        - Appropriate speaking volume (often 10-20% louder than you think).
        - Effective & inclusive language choices. This includes explaining and limiting the use of jargon (your audience doesn't share your domain-specific project background), and using jargon in context so the audience does not need to constantly re-remember its definition. This also includes avoiding using expressions such as "Thanks guys" unless presenting to a solely male audience (you can use "Thanks everyone" or "Thank you all for listening" instead).
        - Include slide numbers so that it is easy to refer back to a slide during the Q&A.
6. Display excellent presentation skills.
    - Speaking clearly and audibly;
    - Engaging the audience with body language and eye contact.
    - Answer questions directly instead of trying to deflect/answer something else. Check with the question asker if you answered them in a satisfactory manner.
7. Be active during the presentation and the following discussion.
    - Each member needs to spend an equal amount of time presenting, and each needs to answer roughly the same amount of questions.
    - During Q&A there's no need to answer immediately; look at your teammates so you aren't stepping over each other trying to answer. Sometimes a single reply is enough, not everyone needs to answer the same question. If you do not know how to answer a question, look to your teammates to see if someone else might be able to rather than starting to talk about another topic just for the sake of saying something.

While the rubric and guidelines above gives an idea of how aspects of your presentation will be weighted during evaluation, the unique context and content of each capstone project will be taken into account when grading.

#### Peer-review activity
- Each student will be assigned 2-3 presentations for peer review. You will fill out the presentation rubric on Canvas and provide written feedback for the group that you are assigned to. 
- Peer review is worth 10% of your presentation proposal grade.
- Peer review activity is to be completed individually 

| Points | Description |
|-|-|
| 0% | Did not complete all assigned peer reviews nor ask any question during Q&A |
| 25% | Fill out the rubric without any comments | 
| 50% | Fill out the rubric with short/unconstructive commets (e.g., okay!, nice!)
| 100% | Fill out the rubric with detailed/constructive comments (e.g., speaker f's voice could be louder, slide 2 could simplify/cutdown the texts, ...)

### 4.2. Proposal Report

The proposal report is worth 10% of your final grade. The report should be a maximum of 1200 words (excluding appendices, figure captions, and table captions). The audience of your report is different to your proposal and is composed of:

1. Primarily, your capstone partner and their organization;
2. Your project mentor;
3. Your fellow group members.

From your report, we expect:

- Excellent writing, including:
  - Low-level (sentence) structure:
    - Your report is written using complete sentences and proper grammar.
    - Everything is written in your own words and you include citations where appropriate.
    - You mean what you say, and say what you mean.
    - Each sentence is necessary in communicating the message of your report.
    - The language you use must be accessible to all audiences (which is probably non-technical), but detailed enough so that you can get adequate feedback on the path you are choosing to take with the project.
  - High-level (paragraph and section) structure:
    - The organization of your report makes sense.
    - The context is properly set at all times.

The report should be concise, being mindful of your Capstone Partner's time. The content of the proposal itself will be graded under the following guidelines:

- The capstone partner's needs (as outlined in the initial meeting with the capstone partner) have been understood.
- The capstone partner's needs have been refined to obtain sensible scientific objectives that are relevant and useful for addressing the capstone partner's needs.  
- The proposed products are useful.
- The proposed data science approach is thoughtful, and **starts simple**.
- The proposal evolved to its final form by adequately soliciting and using feedback from others (including mentors, your colleagues, etc.).
- The report to be created using a reproducible tool (e.g., Jupyter, RMarkdown or LaTeX) and that the source and rendered document are submitted to the mentor.

#### 4.2.1 Using a Reproducible Tool

The proposal reports is to be created using a reproducible tool (e.g., Jupyter, RMarkdown or LaTeX). You should avoid including code in the manuscript document. Instead, we recommend using what you learned in MDS to create a reproducible pipeline to run the necessary scripts/notebooks for figure creation (e.g., a Makefile). Below are a few resources to refresh your memory:

- [DSCI 522 lecture on Makefiles](https://pages.github.ubc.ca/MDS-2020-21/DSCI_522_dsci-workflows_students/lectures/05_lecture-make-driver-script.html)
- [An example repo created by Tiffany to support the above notes](https://github.com/ttimbers/breast_cancer_predictor)
- [This excellent tutorial from Software Carpentry](https://swcarpentry.github.io/make-novice/)
- [An example (public) repo of a past capstone project](https://github.com/mfqqio/rock_predictor)
- [Jupyter Book documentation](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html)

## 5. Helpful Hints

Here are some things to keep in mind while you go through the proposal process:

- The capstone partner may have communicated their needs as "fit model X to get results Y". This is not actually the capstone partner's needs. Their needs are higher level than that, and are related to having some sort of impact on their organization. An understanding of this is key to any consulting project. Ask how your capstone partner will be using the results in their organization.
- You're in charge when it comes to deciding on appropriate data science techniques for addressing the capstone partner's needs. If the partner suggests some methodologies, you don't have to use them (though it might be a good idea to consider what they have to say).
- Your proposed output, products, and methods will probably change throughout the capstone course. This happens for most consulting projects, and is why we have weekly high-level meetings, so that we can re-evaluate project goals and approaches. As such, don't fret about trying to perfectly predict the path you'll take on this project in the proposal.
